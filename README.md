# GRMA

Hello and welcome to our repo for Generalized Regression Models Reading and Conference class. Here you will find folders containing the student's code used in thic class. 


## Todo for wk3: 
 - Setup this repo on your personal computer - see workflow.md for details (shoutout to the amazing Charlotte Wickham for providing this resource, which is lightly modified (changing master>main, and replacing ))
 - Create your own folder, titled something like your name, and go through the workflow process. Include your Chapter 4 questions r code in this folder.
