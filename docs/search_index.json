Note that we can have more than one (but won’t plot it then), and then this becomes multivariate regression. Something that is an estimated quantity will have a hat over it. For example, we might assume that there is some ‘true’ (but unknown) linear relationship between our explanatory variables and our predictor. \\[ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\] From our sample data, we use a linear model to make an estimate of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), so our estimate/best guess of this true model relationship is \\[ \\hat y = \\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1 x\\] We of course want our \\(\\hat\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\) to be a ‘good’ and ‘close’ estimate of the unknown quantities \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). Ideas of what ‘good’ and ‘close’ mean will be covered in the next section. 2.3 Assumptions of linear mordels Linear models assume: The relationship between the explanatory variables and the The samples are independent. The variance is constant The errors are normally distributed with mean 0. We can write these assumptions down in notation as such. \\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon_i \\] where \\[ \\epsilon_i \\sim \\text{iid } N(0,\\sigma^2)\\] In words, this means that each this means that the errors are independent and identically distributed by the normal distribution, with mean 0 and constant variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) (notice how there is no subscript \\(i\\) for the variance) How can we tell when these assumptions are violated?
