### Problem 5.8.

+ **1** Show that the gamma distribution is an EDM by identifying $\theta$, $\kappa(\theta)$, and $\phi$.

  + $$\theta = -1/\mu$$
  + $$\kappa(\theta) = -log(-\theta)$$
  + $$\phi = \phi$$
  
  $$\frac{y\theta - \kappa(\theta)}{\phi} = \frac{-y}{\beta}$$
  
  $$a(y;\theta, \phi)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^\alpha}$$
  
+ **2** Show that the saddlepoint approximation for Gaussi
