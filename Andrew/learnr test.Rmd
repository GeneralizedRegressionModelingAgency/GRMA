# Chapter 9: Models for Proportions: Binomial GLMs

## Recall
* GLM - Generalized Linear Model
  * As a regression model, consists of two components: a random component and a systematic components.
  * Assume the response comes from a distribution that belongs to a family of distributions called the *exponential disperson model* family.
 + Distributions in the EDM family have a probability function^[(probabilty *density* function if continuous, probability *mass* function if not).] of the form:
      + Formula (5.1):$$ \mathcal{P}(y; \theta, \phi) = a(y, \phi)\mathrm{exp}
      \left\{
      {\frac{y\theta-\kappa(\theta)}{\phi}} 
      \right\}
      $$
