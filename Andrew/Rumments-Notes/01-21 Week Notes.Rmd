# Reading
## Chapter 5 Generalized Linear Models: Structure
+ 5.1 Introduction and Overview
  + nstr
+ 5.2 The Two Components of Generalized Linear Models
  + Two compponents - A random component and a systematic component.
  + Form depends on answers to two questions
    + What probability is appropriate?
    + How are the explanatory variables related to the mean of the response $\mu$?
+ 5.3 The Random Component: Exponential Dispersion Models
  + 5.3.1 Examples of EDMs
    + GLM assumes the responses come from a distribution that belongs to the exponential dispersion model family.
    + *continuous* EDMs include the normal and gamma distributions.
    + *discrete* EDMs include the Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial distributions.
    
  + 5.3.2. Definition of EDMs
    + Distributions in the EDM family have a probability function^[(probabilty *density* function if continuous, probability *mass* function if not).] of the form:
      + Formula (5.1):$$ \mathcal{P}(y; \theta, \phi) = a(y, \phi)\mathrm{exp}{\frac{y\theta-\kappa(\theta)}{\phi}}  $$ 
      + $\theta$ is the *canonical parameter*
      + $\kappa(\theta)$ is a known function called the *cumulant function*
      + $\phi > 0$ is the *dispersion parameter*
      + $a(y,\phi)$ is a normalizing function ensuring that (5.1) is a probability function.
