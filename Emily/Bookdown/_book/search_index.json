For example, we might assume that there is some ‘true’ relationship \\[ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\] From our sample data, we use a linear model to make an estimate of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), so our estimate/best guess of this true model relationship is \\[ \\hat y = \\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1 x\\] We of course want our \\(\\hat\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\) to be a ‘good’ and ‘close’ estimate of the unknown quantities \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). 1.3 Assumptions of linear mordels Linear models assume How can we tell when these assumptions are violated?
